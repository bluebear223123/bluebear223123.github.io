        <div>
            The piano was invented around the 1700. It was inveted by an Italian harpsichord maker, Bartolomeo
            Cristofori. It
            was originally called the gravicembalo col piano e forte which then became the piano. This was made so as to
            grant
            the musician a greater dynamic range by using hammers instead of quills. Over the course of history, there
            have been
            many famous composers. Examples of who there are below.
